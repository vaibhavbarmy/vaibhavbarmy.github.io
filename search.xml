      <url>/2016/04-02-What-Destiny-Is.html</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Humans by their nature are social animals and like ants need the order to survive in this world order is our foremost need, ever wonder why all the laws and social stigma or institutions or leaders which have dealt such a damage to humanity yet people didnt resist the order at the time they should be led into a war against their own flesh and blood, i.e. another human.</p><a id="more"></a><hr><p>We all have always found ourselves in many or at least one incidence where we used the ideology of destiny or have seen our surrounding setting making a reference to it.</p><p>No??</p><p>Of course, we have it makes us feel that there is a purpose and we will get that no matter what. It makes us feel relevant to this world which is so vast and enormous both outwardly and inwardly. In many dimensions, we humans have tapped into and many we have yet to.</p><p>Now behold my amigos we shall question, and I am gonna take you on a hell of a ride if you are a total believer of destiny slowly then profoundly. You just have to bear the mental simulation.</p><p>Let’s start !!!!</p><p>Cause.</p><p>How is it created what its source is?</p><p>Affinity for an order that is resistance to change.<br>The easiest way to fall into the trap of making one belief in destiny is this one. Humans by their nature are social animals and like ants need the order to survive in this world order is our foremost need, ever wonder why all the laws and social stigma or institutions or leaders which have dealt such a damage to humanity yet people didn’t resist the order at the time they should be led into a war against their own flesh and blood, i.e. another human.</p><p>Belief in free will or independence and Marxist sociology will lead to the conclusion of a tilted balance towards randomness or chaos in our life or the whole meaning of life. If it unfolds how we act and think then you get the point too much to write. aha 😐</p><p>Need to fit in the world.<br>We have never understood the creator of this world or never even can that’s why he is creator also the fact that we align the creation with a creator which can be inherently assumed as a living entity. We understand things only based on what we see if there is a scientist who invents then there must be a creator who created this world?? Indeed such a pity for us.</p><p>As we can’t and made the false assumption, we are doomed to believe that if there is a creator then definitely he must have some scripted life for me. Even going by that he is a creator not a puppet master. He will have better things to create rather than tend to them.</p><p>We don’t understand this world, so we make a false assumption, and hence we finally got us into believing into destiny/fate/karma.</p><p>Hope.<br>Hope lead us to believe in the concept of destiny in many ways unimaginable.</p><p>If we have already got into the trap of the above two causes which in most of the cases we do. Then the task for hope is simple when reality hits, and we can’t clearly see our purpose we make hope our ally to battle on the side of destiny.</p><p>If not then by nature we are expectant for order in our lives, means like something should happen as we want otherwise we will retaliate or get devastated. Life will hit us again and again with its reality till the point we leave expectations side towards hope itself, broken and tired and what will hope say life will be good you are destined to be happy. (Haha sucker hope though) .</p><p>Too much for the cause. Don’t feel like extending this more you must be tired of reading also.</p><p>Conclusion on its way.</p><p>Think about some quotations on destiny get riled up.</p><p>Like this one destiny is the bridge we build to the one we love. One from my fav movie My sassy girl ❤ Do watch it sometime if you haven’t. Bold and confused</p><p>You have to show up to the place your destiny meets you follow patterns be true to yourself go deep courageously year after year.</p><p>You have to seize your destiny from the hands of forces if there is anything as such.</p><p>All in all</p><p>Destiny in two lines according to my introspection and conclusion way back.</p><p>Only those who have achieved the highest and purest self of themselves being in this world have the privilege to call out to this world I was destined to be here not before not after just at that moment of infinite resourcefulness that particular person has experienced.</p><p>Once we have reached your dreams can you say we were destined to be here not before? Till then work hard to achieve your goals.</p><p>I promised to take you all on a hell of a ride, but I failed its only part one of my views and conclusion of destiny in a very shallow philosophical manner.</p><p>The other part is too complicated and weird for one to understand.</p><p>Watch out for part two again when I feel the motivation to pull this topic again.</p><p>Sneak peek … karma, sufferings, how destiny is decided for a particular person, why some people don’t pay for their evil deeds and some always end up, and its relation with the formation of destiny.</p><p>PS: Ahah! Moment for me yesternight.</p><p>A flashback behind the conclusion I made about destiny hit me today. It was in a second year sitting inside the computer lab playing some stupid MMORPG game.</p><p>PPS: Sometimes I feel its a drag to ponder over philosophy alone, so much so less I know.</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Does death come after birth?</p><p>exactly till birth to death, we have observations but what about from death to birth.</p><p>It would be nice for me to read my first post of what death is? Before I start on birth.</p><p>I don’t know exactly where to start from so much to write concisely.</p><p>Ok, I was always a prominent skeptic about rebirth and reincarnations or any of the theory be it religious or scientific however now all my thought experiments are pointing towards them.</p><p>Let’s take that from religious as well as scientific POV and then maybe nature can instill some insights.</p><p><code>Last thing first..</code></p><h3 id="Nature"><a href="#Nature" class="headerlink" title="Nature"></a>Nature</h3><p>We all can sense there are three forces that define it, each and everyday events oscillate around these three.</p><p><code>Creation, Growth, and Destruction.</code></p><p>The same entity or object or person or anything we know can be oscillated or manipulated or constructed to these characteristics,<br>Like for example, thoughts are creative or supporting growth or destructive. Nuclear force can be used to create, sustain civilizations or destroy. Same goes for people.</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/destruction-form-of-creation.png" alt="Alt"></p><h3 id="OSCILLATIONS"><a href="#OSCILLATIONS" class="headerlink" title="OSCILLATIONS"></a>OSCILLATIONS</h3><p>Creation and growth evolve together while destruction work opposite to them 😉 its not a bad thing it is how it is. None is right none is wrong.</p><p>So that means after destruction creation can take place? 😐</p><p>Oscillations go to string theory…</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/stringtheory_shutterstock_24627319.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><h3 id="Science"><a href="#Science" class="headerlink" title="Science"></a>Science</h3><p><code>Now science comes into the picture.</code></p><p>There is a big buzz around Higgs boson or God particle and building of a large particle collider. Michio Kaku is the guy behind string theory.</p><p>According to which every force or every energy or every particle can be understood as if at the core of the musical strings are oscillating on different notes each note changing the nature to something else.. be it an electron, proton.. be it gravitational, electro-magnetism force.</p><p>A real genius he is.. celebrating his birthday tomorrow 🙂 waiting for detection of sparticles (super particles) to test his theory in the same CERN particle collider, hope he succeeds. 😐</p><p>However, what about god’s particle or Higgs boson…</p><p>Ohh it’s a hypothetical particle which explains space is not empty and instead of a fluid or ocean of Higgs boson particles which provide matter its mass…</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/cartoon-explains-higgs-boson-video-1da878a096.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>The more difficult for a matter to pass through this ocean the more drag it feels, the more mass it gains… WoW, let me read my post what past is? again 🙂</p><p>It has been known for the past few decades that our universe is made up of something weird called dark matter and dark energy..? seriously? When I first found out, I said come on give it a better name. 😦</p><p>Well they can’t be detected directly, they don’t interact with matter, or light particles so can’t be observed yet we sense them as ghosts of our universe because they do have mass and consists about 96% of the universe. Did I say ghosts?</p><p>Moreover, there is some dark energy which is pushing everything away from each other hence we hear universe is expanding.. but what exactly can this dark energy be?</p><p>I believe its soul energy which is contrary to its name given we all must already have a preconception of something dark about this energy 😦 😦 maybe scary Ghosts. 😐</p><p>let me explain how I believe that.</p><h3 id="Religion"><a href="#Religion" class="headerlink" title="Religion"></a>Religion</h3><p><code>Religion came into the rescue...</code></p><p>Tell me what you know about the soul or maybe heard from our ancestors or TV etc.</p><p>Well they are inside us… however, where exactly we don’t know for sure</p><p>we don’t know where it comes from what is its nature, characteristics</p><p>well, they don’t interact with our body but drive our body…</p><p>they do have some mass.. again controversial by some experiments on glass fitted dying body… damn these crazy scientists 😐</p><p>now think about whatever I said about dark energy.. everything matches?</p><p>Going by the concept of moksha when a body attains it, the soul becomes eternal it doesn’t have to take rebirth into a body. According to this and Kalki Puran as kalyug goes by more and more soul are united with God before destruction.</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/a-twin.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>That means dark energy if it is genuinely soul energy will increase over time.</p><p>Which is a doubt in the scientific community whether dark energy remains the same or increase with time.</p><p>If it remains the same universe will expand into nothingness and if it increases then.</p><p>one day one moment every possible atom or matter will explode into destruction.</p><p>Hmm thinking it by this way makes me feel we are doomed for destruction. I may be wrong everything I concluded is wishful and dreamy with little proof.</p><p>However, hey I am not here to entertain your every doubt on me or my theories.</p><p>Moreover, here is a bonus…</p><p>Realistic speaking there are instances in history where people can recall their past lives there are a whole lot of articles and documentary on youtube and net, the biggest one is Reincarnation of Anne Frank after around 30 years or something as I remember.</p><p>By Hindu mythology, the nature of one true God can’t be known or understood which I got to know is according to Hinduism reading some posts on quora .. dammit I came to this conclusion way before these gitas and sitas.</p><p>Anyways for all those feminists out there who says there are no women in the three Gods of creation, growth, and destruction… Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh</p><p>I believe society has hidden a long forgotten truth in that. The majority are feminine out of these three Gods of nature or gatekeepers who are ordinary souls but evolved to such extent to be idolized as Gods.</p><p>It’s your job to figure which two out of three are if you are worthy to know as a feminine.</p><p>haha just gone through some not my jobs memes. 😛 🙂</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/not-my-job.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>Another thought which I discovered recently is a bit related to the above concept. there is no such thing as karma or getting bad for evil deeds and good for good</p><p>u get what u desire in the last moments of your death before rebirth u get a choice every day every moment to change your far (rebirth) and near future (present life).</p><p>PS: I am not over analyzing things don’t want to put any constraint on the ideas as opposed to what society tries to, who r they to tell us how everything works here. We all must have heard about the famous monkey shower experiment. We don’t need anyone’s approval to think and do things we feel like to. On the downside, too much of that is terrible. Balance is what we should seek…</p><p>repeat with me .. I am an individual independent citizen of society who has every bit of right to question social reforms for our betterment.</p><p>Screw them…</p><p>repeat with me .. I love and care about society until unless it doesn’t try to change me.</p><p>Screw you guys I am going home 😛 and if nothing makes sense screw me too… Huh?</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/6a00d8341cb36153ef019aff422b8c970c-320wi.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>PPS: Here is a video by Michio Kaku on consciousness how to define it and measure it</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/AAEB-5GOCJ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></p><p>Watch out for physics girl and her website believed to be next Einstein by Harvard.</p><p>PPS: Life has retaken an exciting turn, working on an idea I believe is the next big thing, taking up to read the brave new world, just got my elements cube after 3 months of waiting for delivery.

There always is a shower of unpredictable <strong>tears</strong> , all we can do is lend a consoling ear to people close to him/her .</p><p>However, is death something to be treated in <strong>hushed voices</strong>, we all are afraid to die, and the encounter with it makes us more afraid then we previously were.</p><p>I saw the terror and sense of <strong>seriousness</strong> around it felt like the air has become cold, like nothing good is going to happen in this world, hope is lost … it’s chilling to the core of bone</p><p>However, what exactly is death.</p><ul><li>Is it the seizure of all <strong>biological activities</strong>,</li><li>Is it the seizure of <strong>one’s consciousness,</strong></li><li>Is the start of a <strong>new journey</strong>.</li></ul><p>All the above explanations have their <strong>anomalies</strong>, seeing death as any of the above possible explanation would only give us pain and make us more confused.</p><p>How do we <strong>define consciousness?</strong></p><p>I am aware of who and what I am but then what about people who have lost consciousness and are in a coma and what about a single cell in our body who have a set of task to perform.</p><p>Is consciousness a <strong>by-product</strong> of the <strong>connections</strong> that are made by different <strong>neurons in the brain</strong>?</p><p>If I assume that a set of unconscious cell cant creates something that is conscious, then it means <strong>consciousness is external</strong> to the body which would lead to <strong>soul theory.</strong></p><p>If I assume that even a <strong>single cell</strong> could have <strong>consciousness</strong> then what is the way to <strong>define its consciousness.</strong></p><p>That would mean the way I am aware of myself could be different the way it is aware of itself.</p><p>I hope there is a new adventure after a person die because I don’t want to disappear into nothingness.</p><p>Another thing which crossed my mind is the <strong>life cycle</strong> of a person who dies.

And if not then why we as a society try to impart a sense of morality on someone who doesn’t need it the most…</p><p>All he needs is a good life and more importantly recognition and sense of worth from us</p><p>I didn’t see him after the event and hope he is doing well.</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>]]></content>
