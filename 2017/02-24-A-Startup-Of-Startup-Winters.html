this startup winter.</p><a id="more"></a><hr><p><code>A blessing in disguise it is.</code></p><p>When life gives you lemons you make lemonades, however, there were lemons but no water to make lemonade. üòê</p><p>The most chaotic situation a startup can face is imminent changes to the Indian economy, demonetization, and lack of external funds, resources or support.</p><p>however creativity is only born in chaos, it is only sustained in lack of stability, it is only valued in the absence of security.</p><p>Something unique can only come out of this chaos, as life came into existence through numerous chaotic possibilities.</p><p>Adaptability, perseverance, hard work, customer satisfaction were the topics being discussed every day which have been left out in the glamour of exponential growth, momentum, and exposure during summers of 13-15.</p><p>News of Companies getting shut down and employees released was no news at all in this startup winter.</p><p><code>Even unicorns felt its heat or lack of heat.</code> üòõ</p><p>And baby cockroaches were devoured and hunted by this winter even before they were able to grow.</p><p>Discussions on revenue rather than a 10x return based on user acquisition were what investors and startup pandits were looking for.</p><p>What it showed to young entrepreneurs was a lesson worth it,</p><p><code>That old saying of the customer is always right is in fact true.</code></p><p>That is treating your employees with respect and dignity is a must.</p><p>Treating people as people rather than machines is a must.</p><p>Excellence is something to thrive for rather than exposure and glamour.</p><p>That starting up is something more than a startup, something closer to running a business.</p><p>That early adopters of startup summers are as much flawed and imperfect as we are.</p><p>That an enterprise is for the people, by the people and its foundations are its building blocks.</p><p>That when life punches you hard on your face, you have to stay strong and pull your team up along with you.</p><p>That a leader is not someone who is invulnerable he/she can also be knocked off with one hard punch too‚Ä¶.</p><p>But a good leader is someone who keeps walking or even crawling to motivate his/her followers to do the same and together become a support system for each other.</p><p>That support is by your team rather than an enormous amount of funds you raise.</p><p>That is sometimes waiting to think about what should be the next steps is more critical than plunging into the first idea or opportunity one can see. üôÇ</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote></div><br><br><div><p><span class="badge
