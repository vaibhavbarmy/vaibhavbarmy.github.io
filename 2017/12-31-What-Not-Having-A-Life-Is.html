he/she has no life, walk in their shoes, know them before you make a snap judgment, as you do with your parents.</p><a id="more"></a><hr><p>Have been hearing this new term being used by millennials these days.<br>Which is having a life or not.</p><p>According to which anyone who is not an extrovert and doesn’t like to socialize much doesn’t have a life.</p><p>Coming from my own experience, I have shifted base in more than 6 cities in the past 14 years.</p><p>Had learned all kind of sports when I first left my home for boarding school, came face to face with discipline and ragging, learned survival saw humble tribal people break coconuts with their head in front of the whole school which was a different kind of joy.</p><p>Watched first-day first show and repeat for a week, did numerous night outs with friends to play games while preparing for the most rigorous entrance examination in India.</p><p>Hit on random DU girls during cultural meets, toyed with institute computer labs, broke a lot of rules while in college.</p><p>While working in my first job and separated with most of my friends, made new friends expanded the variety of people in my network, went on with impulsive trips and jumped together in a newfound lake</p><p>On getting transferred to another city with awesome weather, having to start over once again, it hit me for the first time that how increasingly difficult it becomes to make new friends when you grow older<br>Nevertheless, I traveled and explored parts of the city, exploring all kind of music this multi-ethnic city has to offer, mostly alone if I have to.</p><p>But more importantly, I realized.</p><p>Having a life doesn’t always mean to booze and party and repeat…</p><p>Sometimes having a life is to stop to look around…</p><p>Sometimes having a life is to have a purpose…</p><p>Sometimes having a life is to move with the punches life is throwing at you…</p><p>Sometimes having a life is to go through ups and downs like a sinusoidal wave…</p><p>Sometimes it is</p><p>Stopping to look around at people or other living beings…</p><p>Stopping is to appreciate their needs…</p><p>Stopping to take cues from someone that they might need your favorite white jacket more than you, and the joy in giving is not like anything you experienced…</p><p>Or sometimes they just need a simple pat to lift themselves up or just a company in the darkness they sit in afraid to go outside into the light…</p><p>Or they just need your fav parle-g biscuit to feed their puppies.</p><p>Before throwing more bullshit around through your self involved life that he/she has no life, walk in their shoes, know them before you make a snap judgment, as you do with your parents.</p><p>You don’t go around proclaiming that your parents have no life because you know the struggles and sacrifices they did for you.</p><p>What if they have done the same for wrong people over and over and over again because that’s how they are…</p><p>Try to know them, their past their history, knowing that the person might not add anything positive in your life as your parents did, but trust me from my own experience they will when you would least expect it…</p><p>Over the years they must have made a lot of meaningful connections like you have right now and might have to watch those connections become meaningless…</p><p>Just like how leaves fall during fall…</p><p>Posting every second of your life is not equivalent to having a life, it only shows how much an attention seeker you are…</p><p>But who am I to say anything as to how one should live their life…</p><p>I won’t do anything to your ignorance but to be fair, I will give you a hint…</p><p>Give you a hint as you gave me a hint…</p><p>While I write this post in my favorite cafe…</p><p>Because everything apart, ignorance is still a bliss…</p><p>I will keep on exploring the world in my own way while you will in your own way…</p><p>But I won’t go down to your level as to say…</p><p>You have no life…</p><p>Because each and every breath you take and each and every pump your heart make….</p><p>Is a proof that you do…</p><p>Have a life…</p><p>PS: I am complicated, and I know
