I wanted to help them in whatever way I can so I noticed sometimes people give them money which was generally 1 rupee.</p><p>So this one day I came across a beggar near to my home and saw him again and again in a week near my locality, so I assumed he just beg near my location only and</p><p>God has finally given me the chance to help a beggar.</p><p>so next time when I saw him begging while I was playing gully cricket, I went home opened my piggy bank and took a 100 rupees note went to the beggar and tried to give him,</p><p>however, he refused to accept that note and asked me where my home is</p><p>as he told me he wanted to talk to my parents with a smile which was unfamiliar to all the beggars I have previously observed.</p><p>Being shocked and afraid I lied my home is very far from here, there was a sense of understanding in his eyes for me.</p><p>I went back to my home and put that 100 rupees note under my dad’s cloth.</p><p>After the incident, I delved deeper into why he didn’t take the note from me,</p><p>was it because I was a child,</p><p>was it because no one has treated him with this much amount of money in one go.</p><p>What I concluded then maybe he also has a sense of morality which my parents and society always tried to teach me</p><p>But what kind of sense of morality he had? If he can take 1 rupee from a child why couldn’t he take 100</p><p>I now wonder</p><p>Is this sense of morality right? And if not then why we as a society try to impart a sense of morality on someone who doesn’t need it the most…</p><p>All he needs is a good life and more importantly recognition and sense of worth from us</p><p>I didn’t see him after the event and hope he is doing well.</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote></div><br><br><div><p><span class="badge badge-default">#&nbsp;memory</span> &nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="toc"><p class="toc-title"><i class="material-icons" style="vertical-align:middle">toc</i>Toc:</p><div id="tocbot"></div></div></div><br><div class="comments" id="comments"><div class="disqus" style="width:100%"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname="Vaibhav",disqus_config=function(){this.page.url="http://barmy.me/2014/12-10-A-Memory-With-A-Bhikhari-Wala.html",this.page.identifier="/2014/12-10-A-Memory-With-A-Bhikhari-Wala.html"};!function(){var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.src="//"+disqus_shortname+".disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div></div><footer class="footer footer-default"><div class="container"><div class="float-left" style="padding:15px 0"><b>多喝热水</b></div><div class="copyright float-right">&copy;<script>document.write((new Date).getFullYear())</script>&nbsp;<a href="https://hexo.io/zh-cn/" target="_blank">HEXO</a>&nbsp;<i class="material-icons">favorite_border</i> <a href="https://github.com/invom/Material-T" target="_blank">Material-T</a></div></div></footer><script src="/js/core/jquery.min.js?v=3.2.1"></script><script src="/js/main.js"></script><script src="/js/core/popper.min.js"></script><script src="/js/core/bootstrap-material-design.min.js"></script><script src="/js/plugins/moment.min.js"></script><script src="/js/material-kit.min.js?v=2.0.5"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.4.2/tocbot.min.js"></script><script src="/js/post.js"></script><script src="/js/plugins/prettify.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$("pre").addClass("prettyprint linenums"),prettyPrint()})</script></body></html>
