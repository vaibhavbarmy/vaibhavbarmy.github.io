There always is a shower of unpredictable <strong>tears</strong> , all we can do is lend a consoling ear to people close to him/her .</p><p>However, is death something to be treated in <strong>hushed voices</strong>, we all are afraid to die, and the encounter with it makes us more afraid then we previously were.</p><p>I saw the terror and sense of <strong>seriousness</strong> around it felt like the air has become cold, like nothing good is going to happen in this world, hope is lost ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs chilling to the core of bone</p><p>However, what exactly is death.</p><ul><li>Is it the seizure of all <strong>biological activities</strong>,</li><li>Is it the seizure of <strong>one‚Äôs consciousness,</strong></li><li>Is the start of a <strong>new journey</strong>.</li></ul><p>All the above explanations have their <strong>anomalies</strong>, seeing death as any of the above possible explanation would only give us pain and make us more confused.</p><p>How do we <strong>define consciousness?</strong></p><p>I am aware of who and what I am but then what about people who have lost consciousness and are in a coma and what about a single cell in our body who have a set of task to perform.</p><p>Is consciousness a <strong>by-product</strong> of the <strong>connections</strong> that are made by different <strong>neurons in the brain</strong>?</p><p>If I assume that a set of unconscious cell cant creates something that is conscious, then it means <strong>consciousness is external</strong> to the body which would lead to <strong>soul theory.</strong></p><p>If I assume that even a <strong>single cell</strong> could have <strong>consciousness</strong> then what is the way to <strong>define its consciousness.</strong></p><p>That would mean the way I am aware of myself could be different the way it is aware of itself.</p><p>I hope there is a new adventure after a person die because I don‚Äôt want to disappear into nothingness.</p><p>Another thing which crossed my mind is the <strong>life cycle</strong> of a person who dies. The <strong>TIME</strong> for which he lived</p><p>Since <strong>time is relative</strong> for different point for space in the <strong>universe</strong>. Different people live for a different period and the place where time is static (the place of infinite gravity singularity) means the <strong>person didn‚Äôt even exist</strong> for that point nothing exists except the infinite state of rest <strong>NOTHINGNESS</strong></p><p>However, for a <strong>supreme power</strong> which would be God everything and everyone must exist. Which would lead to the conclusion that for God the time scale goes so fast that everything would exist means no Gravity <strong>he must be unperturbed by Gravity.</strong> He must lie outside the boundary of the universe where is nothingness concerning space.</p><p>however, for a person who lives in a time scale like that of this earth, for example, everything and everyone exists too in a time scale then it can be said indeed that</p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúI am part and parcel of God and is equal to god in quality.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote><p>Let‚Äôs also associate the concept of <strong>heaven, hell and Brahma</strong>. Its written in Hindu mythology that <strong>a day for Brahma</strong> is equal to the <strong>life cycle of the earth</strong> and after that, he <strong>destroys</strong> everything and once again is <strong>created.</strong></p><p><strong>Brahma</strong> can have a <strong>time scale</strong> which may be <strong>relatively slow</strong>.</p><p>Could the <strong>destruction</strong> and <strong>rebirth</strong> be compared to the <strong>big bang</strong>, because a point from where big bang started also has a <strong>slow time scale</strong> and is a <strong>limit to singularity</strong> or <strong>infinite gravity</strong>?</p><p>PS: Life has retaken an exciting turn, reading Mein Kamph and Freud‚Äôs Interpretation of dreams, skating whenever I get the time to (it‚Äôs too cold), watched Interstellar.. awesome movie üôÇ</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote></div><br><br><div><p><span class="badge badge-default">#&nbsp;philosophy</span> &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="col-md-3" id="toc"><i class="material-icons" style="vertical-align:middle">toc</i>Toc:</div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2"><div class="disqus" style="width:100%"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname="vaibhav",disqus_config=function(){this.page.url="http://barmy.me/2014/12-12-What-Death-Is.htm",this.page.identifier="/2014/12-12-What-Death-Is.htm"};!function(){var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.src="//"+disqus_shortname+".disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer-default"><div class="container"><div class="float-left" style="padding:15px 0"><b>Â§öÂñùÁÉ≠Ê∞¥</b></div><div class="copyright float-right">&copy;<script>document.write((new Date).getFullYear())</script>&nbsp;<a href="https://hexo.io/zh-cn/" target="_blank">HEXO</a>&nbsp;<i class="material-icons">favorite_border</i> <a href="https://github.com/invom/Material-T" target="_blank">Material-T</a></div></div></footer><script src="/js/core/jquery.min.js?v=3.2.1"></script><script src="/js/main.js"></script><script src="/js/core/popper.min.js"></script><script src="/js/core/bootstrap-material-design.min.js"></script><script src="/js/plugins/moment.min.js"></script><script src="/js/plugins/nouislider.min.js"></script><script src="/js/material-kit.min.js?v=2.0.5"></script><script src="/js/plugins/prettify.js"></script><script>$(window).on("load",function(){$("pre").addClass("prettyprint linenums"),prettyPrint()})</script></body></html>
