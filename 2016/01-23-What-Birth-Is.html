Does death come after birth?</p><p>exactly till birth to death, we have observations but what about from death to birth.</p><p>It would be nice for me to read my first post of what death is? Before I start on birth.</p><p>I don’t know exactly where to start from so much to write concisely.</p><p>Ok, I was always a prominent skeptic about rebirth and reincarnations or any of the theory be it religious or scientific however now all my thought experiments are pointing towards them.</p><p>Let’s take that from religious as well as scientific POV and then maybe nature can instill some insights.</p><p><code>Last thing first..</code></p><h3 id="Nature"><a href="#Nature" class="headerlink" title="Nature"></a>Nature</h3><p>We all can sense there are three forces that define it, each and everyday events oscillate around these three.</p><p><code>Creation, Growth, and Destruction.</code></p><p>The same entity or object or person or anything we know can be oscillated or manipulated or constructed to these characteristics,<br>Like for example, thoughts are creative or supporting growth or destructive. Nuclear force can be used to create, sustain civilizations or destroy. Same goes for people.</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/destruction-form-of-creation.png" alt="Alt"></p><h3 id="OSCILLATIONS"><a href="#OSCILLATIONS" class="headerlink" title="OSCILLATIONS"></a>OSCILLATIONS</h3><p>Creation and growth evolve together while destruction work opposite to them 😉 its not a bad thing it is how it is. None is right none is wrong.</p><p>So that means after destruction creation can take place? 😐</p><p>Oscillations go to string theory…</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/stringtheory_shutterstock_24627319.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><h3 id="Science"><a href="#Science" class="headerlink" title="Science"></a>Science</h3><p><code>Now science comes into the picture.</code></p><p>There is a big buzz around Higgs boson or God particle and building of a large particle collider. Michio Kaku is the guy behind string theory.</p><p>According to which every force or every energy or every particle can be understood as if at the core of the musical strings are oscillating on different notes each note changing the nature to something else.. be it an electron, proton.. be it gravitational, electro-magnetism force.</p><p>A real genius he is.. celebrating his birthday tomorrow 🙂 waiting for detection of sparticles (super particles) to test his theory in the same CERN particle collider, hope he succeeds. 😐</p><p>However, what about god’s particle or Higgs boson…</p><p>Ohh it’s a hypothetical particle which explains space is not empty and instead of a fluid or ocean of Higgs boson particles which provide matter its mass…</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/cartoon-explains-higgs-boson-video-1da878a096.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>The more difficult for a matter to pass through this ocean the more drag it feels, the more mass it gains… WoW, let me read my post what past is? again 🙂</p><p>It has been known for the past few decades that our universe is made up of something weird called dark matter and dark energy..? seriously? When I first found out, I said come on give it a better name. 😦</p><p>Well they can’t be detected directly, they don’t interact with matter, or light particles so can’t be observed yet we sense them as ghosts of our universe because they do have mass and consists about 96% of the universe. Did I say ghosts?</p><p>Moreover, there is some dark energy which is pushing everything away from each other hence we hear universe is expanding.. but what exactly can this dark energy be?</p><p>I believe its soul energy which is contrary to its name given we all must already have a preconception of something dark about this energy 😦 😦 maybe scary Ghosts. 😐</p><p>let me explain how I believe that.</p><h3 id="Religion"><a href="#Religion" class="headerlink" title="Religion"></a>Religion</h3><p><code>Religion came into the rescue...</code></p><p>Tell me what you know about the soul or maybe heard from our ancestors or TV etc.</p><p>Well they are inside us… however, where exactly we don’t know for sure</p><p>we don’t know where it comes from what is its nature, characteristics</p><p>well, they don’t interact with our body but drive our body…</p><p>they do have some mass.. again controversial by some experiments on glass fitted dying body… damn these crazy scientists 😐</p><p>now think about whatever I said about dark energy.. everything matches?</p><p>Going by the concept of moksha when a body attains it, the soul becomes eternal it doesn’t have to take rebirth into a body. According to this and Kalki Puran as kalyug goes by more and more soul are united with God before destruction.</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/a-twin.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>That means dark energy if it is genuinely soul energy will increase over time.</p><p>Which is a doubt in the scientific community whether dark energy remains the same or increase with time.</p><p>If it remains the same universe will expand into nothingness and if it increases then.</p><p>one day one moment every possible atom or matter will explode into destruction.</p><p>Hmm thinking it by this way makes me feel we are doomed for destruction. I may be wrong everything I concluded is wishful and dreamy with little proof.</p><p>However, hey I am not here to entertain your every doubt on me or my theories.</p><p>Moreover, here is a bonus…</p><p>Realistic speaking there are instances in history where people can recall their past lives there are a whole lot of articles and documentary on youtube and net, the biggest one is Reincarnation of Anne Frank after around 30 years or something as I remember.</p><p>By Hindu mythology, the nature of one true God can’t be known or understood which I got to know is according to Hinduism reading some posts on quora .. dammit I came to this conclusion way before these gitas and sitas.</p><p>Anyways for all those feminists out there who says there are no women in the three Gods of creation, growth, and destruction… Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh</p><p>I believe society has hidden a long forgotten truth in that. The majority are feminine out of these three Gods of nature or gatekeepers who are ordinary souls but evolved to such extent to be idolized as Gods.</p><p>It’s your job to figure which two out of three are if you are worthy to know as a feminine.</p><p>haha just gone through some not my jobs memes. 😛 🙂</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/not-my-job.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>Another thought which I discovered recently is a bit related to the above concept. there is no such thing as karma or getting bad for evil deeds and good for good</p><p>u get what u desire in the last moments of your death before rebirth u get a choice every day every moment to change your far (rebirth) and near future (present life).</p><p>PS: I am not over analyzing things don’t want to put any constraint on the ideas as opposed to what society tries to, who r they to tell us how everything works here. We all must have heard about the famous monkey shower experiment. We don’t need anyone’s approval to think and do things we feel like to. On the downside, too much of that is terrible. Balance is what we should seek…</p><p>repeat with me .. I am an individual independent citizen of society who has every bit of right to question social reforms for our betterment.</p><p>Screw them…</p><p>repeat with me .. I love and care about society until unless it doesn’t try to change me.</p><p>Screw you guys I am going home 😛 and if nothing makes sense screw me too… Huh?</p><p><img src="https://immosmeaningoflife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/6a00d8341cb36153ef019aff422b8c970c-320wi.jpg" alt="Alt"></p><p>PPS: Here is a video by Michio Kaku on consciousness how to define it and measure it</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/AAEB-5GOCJ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></p><p>Watch out for physics girl and her website believed to be next Einstein by Harvard.</p><p>PPS: Life has retaken an exciting turn, working on an idea I believe is the next big thing, taking up to read the brave new world, just got my elements cube after 3 months of waiting for delivery.
