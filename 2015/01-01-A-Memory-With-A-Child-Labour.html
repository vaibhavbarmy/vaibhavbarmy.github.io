Do I need anything. (Holy mother of God I will ask u by myself if I need anything .. lol :P)</p><p>I just stood up and took the salt from the neighboring table like I do many times‚Ä¶</p><p>It is a quicker way in place of asking a waiter to bide me his service.</p><p>He noticed it, and there was a sad expression.</p><p>So while billing, I gave him a double to the general tip of 10 rupees.</p><p>Now bear with me amigos what happened next hold a special place in my mind.</p><p>There was an expression of surprise and then ecstasy when I gave him 20 rupees as the tip,</p><p>and the way he took the note to his head in a religious way fitted everything perfectly.</p><p>Life sure is good, and people sure are fantastic.
